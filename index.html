        <article class="career-hist">
          <h4>Career History</h4>
            <p class="career-txt"> I started my career as a dealership technician for MINI in January of 2012. I worked 
                within that brand for five and a half years before switching to BMW for the past 4 years. 
                Through out my career I have learned various skills and worked with cutting edge technology in 
                 the automotive field. I was able to obtain my ASE Master technician status over the 
                 course of my nine and a half year career. I think much of the experience I have diagnosing 
                 intricate automotive issues will lend itself useful in the world of web development.

            <h4>Personal Interests</h4>
              <p class="intrests-txt">When I am not trying to learn more about my new field, I enjoy a wide range of hobbies.
                  I love working on classic cars, the simplicity of them is quite thereputic. I also enjoy
                  a multitude of outdoors activities from hiking and camping to driving 4x4 trails and 
                  tubing down rivers. Learning is a never ending hobby for me and I often find myself 
                  researching some mundane topic until the dark hours of the night. Anything where creating
                  something from scratch is always an interesting task for me.

        <article class="goals">
            <h4>Future goals</h4>
              <p class="goals-txt">Currently I am working through completeing Denver University's coding bootcamp in hopes of 
                  making a successful career switch. After completeing this bootcamp I plan on expanding my 
                  knowledge of computer languages. I would eventually like to program my own video game and 
                  possibly open my own business with the new skills I am aquiring.
